_''-but satan waits upstairs, watching over his daughter, she writes emo songs, she's so depressed! her lyrics are naive but she still sings her heart out, thе only way she knows how to confess.''_

# BEFORE YOU INTERACT !!

i am alot of the time in some sort of bad mood, and dont often want to interact with people im unfamiliar with! this is nothing personal, i just am *very* often paranoid and dont trust people due to past experiences

how i act depends alot on my mood, and i can sometimes come off as rude or cold because of this (also i have mood swings like. constantly. fear!)

i have had issues with people not being able to tell my tone, if you cannot tell my tone and i havent used a tone tag just ask for one!

**alot** of "small" things trigger me (it wont all be listed on my github, but **some** are in my rentries.), and can cause me to go into episodes. please be aware of this before interacting with me

i have slight td on ponytown, please ask before doing anything (doesnt apply if i am familiar with you and/or youre my friend!)

i make kms/kys jokes, and say slurs i can reclaim

i have episodic delusiouns of a few characters im very strongly attachted to

i am anxious when talking to new people, so if u want to interact just like.. whisper me (public chat my biggest opp) (soo targetted at the cool mfs in md... you guys wanna be my friend soooo bad...)

i have **genuine** memory issues, please dont give me a hard time about it

i tend to mix up words alot or spell things wrong

mentally ill (very obvious)

also im just kinda. stupid in general.

DNIUSF = do not interact unless silly freaks, aka my friend group name! if this is in my name and youre NOT in the friend group but still try to interact with me, ur getting ignored i fear! its there for a reason

**i quite literally dont care if you think im sensitive, these are my boundaries that i put in place to help myself feel comfortable! if you think its stupid just like.. dont interact w/ me idfk?**

// note: **IF ANYTHING I DO MAKES YOU UNCOMFORTABLE, PLEASE TELL ME IMMEDIATELY! MY INTENT IS NEVER TO MAKE PEOPLE UNCOMFORTABLE AND SOMETIMES I FORGET OR CANT READ TONE!**

_''and as she gеts up to shut the bedroom door behind her, he stands right beside her, she's trying to get her head on straight! with box dye hair to match her black thigh highs, and scratched nail polish, she performs femininity-''_

# CAUTION *WHEN* INTERACTING !!

if you already are my friend on ponytown, this means im comfortable enough interacting with you, but you dont know me that well (assuming) so heres just some shit to like. not do when were interacting! this is mainly just jokes im uncomfortable with, or just some general triggers/media i dont like, since i didnt just want to put it in dni

extremely detailed nsfw jokes, really weird nsfw jokes, or making nsfw jokes directed towards me (unless ive said im fine w/ it) or my friend group (literally kys.) //note: (im fine w/ nsfw jokes, just as long as it isnt detailed/weird)

dont use racial slurs, even if u can reclaim them! i have an extremely bad history with racial slurs, specifcally any against hispanics, and id just prefer if you dont! if thats how u joke, its fine (as long as u can reclaim!), just maybe not around me!

no graphic details about s/h, or jokes about it! (im fine w/ a mention, just no details)

please dont mention tdi around me. i will genuinely start to panic /srs. even if i have my bridgette skin on, its because im extremely attatched to her and am delusional about her! im fine w/ like really short convos abt it but like no actual discussions, especially about DJ or Carrie. //note: if im already actively talking about tdi, then its fine! if i stop talking abt it tho pls dont continue.)

if u have a tails cosplay literally do not equip it around me illl also start to panic.. its only that specific character im fine w/ any other sonic character (if u do i fear ur either getting hidden, unadded, or ignored (if i already asked u to not)) 

i do not like mitski, laufey, kevin macleod, or alex g.. its literally NOTHING against them personally, theyre just tied to the memories of people i hate. i dont rlly care if you like them/listen to their music but try to avoid mentioning

if youre in tdds, quite literally dont mention anything about them at all to me. no exceptions to this i fear, if you do after ive asked youre getting hidden/blocked sorry (if u dont even know what tdds are, this isnt relevant to you LOL)

// note: i do not care if u think these are "weird" or that im overdramatic, most of this shit is because of shit ive gone through that i dont want to me reminded of, thanks! if u dont respect these just dont interact with me!!

# SIMPLE DNI !!

// note: this dni is for ponytown specifically, i have a much more detailed dni rentry (along with a blacklist rentry)

people who dont respect dni, td/tt, or anything along those lines

people who copy skins (applies to tut skins, ur not rlly learning anything if u just copy and paste imo + seeing like 20 million of the same cosplay makes me evil..)

roleplayers, specifically roleplayers who try to roleplay with random people who dont want to

people who treat me as the character im cosplaying (unless stated otherwise, it is a cosplay! do not treat me like the character, it makes me extremely uncomfortable.)

people who make nsfw avatars (ur weird)

changeling skins,, idk yall just dont respect dni and r so dramamtic when i tell yall to fuck off?? go interact with people who want to.

people who are rude to anyone in my friend group! kys i do not like you!
