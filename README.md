# BEFORE YOU INTERACT !!

i am alot of the time in some sort of bad mood, and dont often want to interact with people im unfamiliar with! this is nothing personal, i just am *very* often paranoid and dont trust people due to past experiences

how i act depends alot on my mood, and i can sometimes come off as rude or cold

i have had issues with people not being able to tell my tone, if you cannot tell my tone and i havent used a tone tag just ask for one!

**alot** of "small" things trigger me (it wont be listed here, but **some** are in my rentries.), and can cause me to go into episodes. please be aware of this before interacting with me

i have slight td on ponytown, please ask before doing anything (doesnt apply if i am familiar with you and/or youre my friend!)

i make kms/kys jokes, and say slurs i can reclaim

i have episodic delusiouns of a few characters im very strongly attachted to

i am anxious when talking to new people, so if u want to interact just like.. whisper me (public chat my biggest opp)

i have genuine memory issues, please dont give me a hard time about it

i tend to mix up words alot or spell things wrong

mentally ill (very obvious)

i quite literally dont care if you think im sensitive, these are my boundaries that i put in place to help myself feel comfortable! if you think its stupid just like.. dont interact w/ me idfk?

// note: IF ANYTHING I DO MAKES YOU UNCOMFORTABLE, PLEASE TELL ME IMMEDIATELY! MY INTENT IS NEVER TO MAKE PEOPLE UNCOMFORTABLE AND SOMETIMES I FORGET OR CANT READ TONE!
