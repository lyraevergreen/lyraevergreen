how i act changes ALOT on my mood, and i have constant mood swings!

if im behind a tree, it is superr likely i wanna be left alone, unless im actively whispering you or youre already my friend, please leave me alone

i have a slight td/tt! if you are not my friend please dont cuddle/boop/etc me on ponytown without asking ^^

i do make kms/kys jokes, and say slurs that i can reclaim. if this makes you uncomfortable, LET ME KNOW!! i will not make them around you!

**IF ANYTHING I DO MAKES YOU UNCOMFORTABLE, PLEASE LET ME KNOW! MY INTENT IS NEVER TO MAKE PEOPLE FEEL UMCOMFORTABLE**
