## BEFORE YOU INTERACT! 

how i act changes ALOT on my mood, and i have constant mood swings! because of this, its really likely i dont feel like interacting with people im not extremely close to, so pls dont take it to heart if i ignore you or walk away!

if im behind a tree, it is superr likely i wanna be left alone, unless im actively whispering you or youre already my friend, please leave me alone

i have a slight td/tt! if you are not my friend please dont cuddle/boop/etc me on ponytown without asking ^^

i do make kms/kys jokes, and say slurs that i can reclaim. if this makes you uncomfortable, LET ME KNOW!! i will not make them around you!

**IF ANYTHING I DO MAKES YOU UNCOMFORTABLE, PLEASE LET ME KNOW! MY INTENT IS NEVER TO MAKE PEOPLE FEEL UMCOMFORTABLE**

// note: if my name has "SF" in it (ex: DNIUSF), it is the name of my friend group!! if it is like this, please respect it and do NOT interact with me unless you are in said friend goup!!!

_''and as they stop to look at her they won't look further, like it's not a murder, it's an inevitable tragedy! the bloody hands of all the heartless fuckers, who emotionally fucked her to, monetize her suffering. flipping through a spiral notebook for some sad hopeless words, to turn into a liturgy. so she'll never leave her bedroom, in this bedroom community!!!!!''_
